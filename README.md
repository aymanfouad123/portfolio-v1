# portfolio-v1  

a simple "api request" style portfolio page since i was working a lot with those during my internship.  

## about  
after spending more than a year dealing with api requests at my internship, i made this little site that mimics the request/response flow. click the buttons to "fetch" or "post" data about me.  

## setup  

1. clone the repo:  
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-v1.git
 cd portfolio-v1
 ```
2. install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
3. run locally:
```
npm run dev
```

## customize
just edit data/portfolioData.js with your own info if you want to use it.
