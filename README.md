# portfolio-v1

A simple portfolio page inspired by the APIs I worked with during my internship.

## about

after spending more than a year dealing with api requests at my internship, i made this little site that mimics the request/response flow. click the buttons to "fetch" or "post" data about me.

## setup

1. clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-v1.git
cd portfolio-v1
```

2. install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. run locally:

```
npm run dev
```

## customize

just edit data/portfolioData.js with your own info if you want to use it.
